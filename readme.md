# HAIL-CAESAR

This is the development version of the HAIL-CAESAR model. 

HAIL-CAESAR is a hydrodynamic, landscape evolution, cellular automaton model. In other words, it simulates hydrological and erosional processes in a river catchment, for the purposes of investigating flood-inundation, sediment transport and catchment evolution over a range of timescales from hours to thousands of years. (And potentially longer if you are really patient enough...)

The model is derived from the [CAESAR-Lisflood model](https://sourceforge.net/projects/caesar-lisflood/), which is a C#/.NET Windows-based implementation of the model, with a very useful GUI. You may find much of the documentation and discussion for CAESAR-Lisflood relevant for using HAIL-CAESAR, but remember there are small differences at present, so treat the documentation [here](http://hail-caesar.readthedocs.io/en/latest) as the canonical source.

HAIL-CAESAR doesn't have a GUI - the model is run from scripts or from typing commands at the command line/terminal. The model runs and writes output directly to files on disk. You then have to process these output files yourself to view the model output subsequently. 

[LSDMappingTools](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools) is a good package for visualising the output and producing research-quality figures from HAIL-CAESAR. GIS programs, such as the excellent [QGIS](www.qgis.org) are also useful.
